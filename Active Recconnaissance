nmap 
    -V - lists version
    -d - debugs the output
    -sA - indicates whether the firewall is present or not.(filtered-firewall is present, (open | filtered)-port is accessible but might be open or closed).
    -r  -  scan ports consecutively, do not randomize
    -6  - scans for ipv6 address
    -n  - do not resolve host names(saves time)
    -R  - resolves host names
    -A  - Scans for OS detection, service version detection, script scanning, and traceroute.
    -PR - ARP scan which isnt generally blocked by firewall.(Discovery Scan)
    -sn - No port scan is conducted.(Discovery scan)
    -PS - Discover hosts by sending TCP SYN to specific port. EG: -PS135 (No spaces)
    -sN - Sends request with no flags set.
    -sF - TCP FIN
    -f  - fragment packets
    -D  - Decoys, where many alternate Pc will also request for the same request making us insuspicious.

* Port number 135 is likey seen only on Windows machine, similiarly 111 is seen on *nix computers.

Imap Encrypted port Number - 993(143)
POP3  ''       ''    ''    - 995 (110)
SMTP  ''       ''    ''    - 465(25)

* we can customize the packets using Hpin3 to see how the target firewall ruleset is defined and spoofed packets can be sent through the hping3.
* In metasploit we can serach: Search eternalblue type:exploit, type:payload, platform: Linux.
* WMI and SNMP can be used for enumerating the devices.
* The administrator SID will always be 500 in windows. rpcclient can also be used for windows host enumeration.
* In Linux-
            w- lists the current logged in users and theor processes.
            uname -a - show alll available information of the systems.
            netstat-antp - shows tcp listening processes and theirsocket status
            netstat-anup-shows udp status
            cat /etc/*-release - shows distribution information.
            cat /etc/resolv.conf - shows default dns information.
   *rpcclient can also be used in l inux for enumerating the information.
   Mount and showmount can be used to see the share that paticular IP is sharing a d can be connected to that share. (nfs-common -  install this package for connecting to share using mount).
   
   * In previous linux and windows based systems, null sessions are possible where network share information are retreived. --> net use \\<server-name-or-IP\ipc$ /u:"" "".
