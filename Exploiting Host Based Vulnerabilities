* All Windows OS and Applications are written in C language which doesnt check for any bound-checking. so these should be done explicitly by developers.
* Servers systems are most likely to have the network vulnerabilities whereas workstation consists of end-user or application based vulnerabilities.
* frequently exploited windows features:
                                          Null sessions- allows anonymous connection to IPC$ share.
                                          LM password hash.
                                          IIS 5.0 unicode.
                                          IIS 5.0 WebDAV.
                                          RPC DCOM.
                                          SMB NetAPI.
                                          
* passwords are stored as two types of hashes:
                                                LM(LanMan):where it UPPERCASES the passowrd then truncated or padded to 14 char long.it is divided in to two 7-bit.
                                                NT hash: it is MD$ hash of the password.
                                                DES_CBC_MD5: used for kerberos authentication.
* Active directory stores passwords in ntds.dit where it can be taken and offline brute force acn be conducted.
* Credential dumps in windows:
                              LSA secrets dump - This technique attempts to crack passwords stored in the Registry (HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/Security/Policy/Secrets) by the Local Security Authority Subsystem (LSASS).
                              hash dump - You can dump hashes directly from the Registry hives HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM and HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SAM and pass them to a cracker.
                              SYSKEY boot key - SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Lsa\JD(bkhive,bkreg tools can be used).
                              cpasswprd dump - Read and crack the cPassword value from the Group Policy Preferences (GPP) file.
                              
* also check for: TCP 5985: WinRM
                  UDP 1900: UPnP/SSDP
                  UDP 5355: LLMNR
                  
* Most windows file system(NTFS) vulnerabilities are due to improper permissions.
* Alternate Data Streams(ADS)- it can be used to hide files in the system.
