*Difference between penetration testing and vulnerability assesment?
  
    The primary difference is #Validation. Vulnerability analysts look for the vulnerabilities in the software whereas pentesters find the vulnerabilities and exploit the vulnerabilities if they are vulnerable.

*Remediation is the process of implementing a solution for a vulnerability.
*point-in-time assesment is used to state that the testing is valid only for the scope of the testing process.
* Threat models specifically find the attack vectors and demistifies the attack vectors such that the attack couldnt be happened again.
* Whitelisting is more secure than blacklisting.
*A clause that details boundaries with regard to scope, price, and time frame is part of a comprehensiveness disclaimer.
