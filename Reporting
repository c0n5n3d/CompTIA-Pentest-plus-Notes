* To counter the ARP poisoning, static ARP tables can be written on static hosts or we can implement IDS for monitoring.
* Some of the remediation that can be implemented to shared local administrator credentials are:
      Avoid sharing login credentials if at all possible.
      Require users to use their own credentials for accountability if possible.
      If credentials must be shared, randomize them.
      Use Local Administrator Password Solution (LAPS), which is a Microsoft solution that uses Active Directory (AD) to store local administrator passwords.
* For XSS the most type of sanitization is "Escaping of data". it is similar to encoding where after escaping the malicious char such as <>,& from being processed by browser.
* Parameterized queries also known as prepared statements are best from securing the sql injection attack. 
* $stmt = $db_conn->prepare("INSERT INTO products (prod_name, prod_desc) VALUES (:prod_name, :prod_desc)"); 
* The INSERT INTO query is prepared, essentially creating a template for the database to parse. This parsed template is stored without being executed.

Sections is pen test report.
*Executive summary - summarizes the content of the entire report, created after the report has been written. It should state the tasks that were conducted during the testing.
                     It should end with the high-level findings and suggested remediation for those findings.
* Methodology - This section describes the activities performed to conduct the testing.It should include steps that can be independently repeated so that findings can be validated.
* Findings and remediation - This section is often presented as a table that identifies the vulnerability, the threat level, the risk rating, and whether the vulnerability was able to be exploited.
                              It should also include the steps needed for remediation of the vulnerability.
* Metrics and measures - criticality of vulnerability findings(sclae of 1 to 10).Measures are the specific data points that contribute to a metric i.e no of systems that are affected according to metric.
* Risk Rating - The risk rating levels can include more granular levels of likelihood and impact than what is shown in this graphic.
* Conclusion - This section wraps up the report. It should include a general summary statement about failures (and successes), with supporting evidence that can be written in a sentence or two.
* Supporting evidence - Any supporting evidence, or attestation of findings, should be attached to the report.
* Report disposition is the transfer of report and all douments to the client.
* Attestation is perhaps the most significant component of gaining client acceptance.
* LLR- lessons learned report  and AAR- after action report helps to correct and learn from mistakes done by pentest team.
