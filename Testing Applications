* Security misconfigurations exploits:
                                      Cookie manipulation(Storing sensitive data on client side).
                                      Directory traversal 
                                      Encoding Directory Traversal Requests
                                      Poison null byte- With a poison null byte, you can use this termination character to exploit a web app that does not properly handle null terminators.
                                          http://site.example/page.php?file=../../etc/passwd%00 (%00 representation of posion null byte).
   * Authentication attacks:
                             cracking credentials
                             session hijacking
                             redirection
                             
    * A more advanced redirect attack involves exploiting the returnUrl parameter in Microsoft's ASP.NET web app framework. 
    This parameter is used in instances where a user tries to access a legitimate page requiring authentication, but their authentication cookie has either expired or needs to be generated.
