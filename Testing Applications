* Security misconfigurations exploits:
                                      Cookie manipulation(Storing sensitive data on client side).
                                      Directory traversal 
                                      Encoding Directory Traversal Requests
                                      Poison null byte- With a poison null byte, you can use this termination character to exploit a web app that does not properly handle null terminators.
                                          http://site.example/page.php?file=../../etc/passwd%00 (%00 representation of posion null byte).
   * Authentication attacks:
                             cracking credentials
                             session hijacking
                             redirection
                             
    * A more advanced redirect attack involves exploiting the returnUrl parameter in Microsoft's ASP.NET web app framework. 
    This parameter is used in instances where a user tries to access a legitimate page requiring authentication, but their authentication cookie has either expired or needs to be generated.
    
    * Authorization attacks:
                            parameter pollution
                            Insecure Direct Object reference(IDOR)
   * The most common type of code injection is SQL Injection. in SQL Injection,UNION operations only work when both querieshave the same number of columns.
   * Cross site scripting includes javascript to execurte on the users browser.
   *  LFI can also leverage the poison null byte to bypass security mechanisms that restrict the request to .php files. 
   * Static code analysis is also known as Lightbox testing.
   * Static analysis reveals a low-level perspective of an app's logic.while dynamic testing,low-lwvwl perspective cant be foreseen.
   * three primary methods of performing reverse engineering: decompilation, disassembly, and debugging. 
   *Decompilation is the reverse engineering process of translating an executable into high-level source code. it also invloves translating the compiled binaries to source code.
   * Disassembly is the reverse engineering process of translating low-level machine code into higher level assembly language code
